## Copy Authorization Header Extension

This privacy policy outlines how the Copy Authorization Header extension handles user data.

1. **No Personal or Sensitive Data Handling**
   - The Copy Authorization Header extension does not collect, store, or process any personal or sensitive user data. The extension solely captures `Authorization` tokens from HTTP requests for the purpose of managing and copying them per domain.

2. **Data Usage**
   - The captured `Authorization` tokens are stored locally on the user's device and are not transmitted to any external servers. The tokens are used exclusively within the extension for user convenience.

3. **User Control**
   - Users have full control over the extensionâ€™s functionality, including the ability to enable or disable it at any time. Users can also delete any stored tokens from their local storage via the extension interface.

4. **Disclaimer of Responsibility**
   - The developer of the Copy Authorization Header extension does not accept any responsibility for the misuse or unintended consequences resulting from the use of this extension. Users are advised to use the extension responsibly and at their own risk.

5. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**
   - We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the effective date will be updated accordingly.

By using the Copy Authorization Header extension, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this privacy policy.
